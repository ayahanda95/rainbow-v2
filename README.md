# Let’s Create a Rainbow

Let’s Create a Rainbow is an educational game for children below 6 years of age to learn about the colours of the rainbow in a fun way. It combines learning with play. Children will learn that they can accomplish tasks, make small decisions on their own and improve their hand and eye coordination. There are seven levels developed in this game to represent the seven colours of the rainbow. Each level uses a different environment setup as the background of the game. The development of this game is conducted based on ADDIE methodology which consists of Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation phases. At the end of the project development, a functional testing is done to ensure that the game is error-free and ready to be used by the user.
